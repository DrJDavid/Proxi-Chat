## Current Implementation Progress

### Completed âœ…
1. Project setup and configuration
2. Database schema design and implementation
3. Basic UI components
4. Authentication foundation
5. Type definitions for Supabase
6. Basic routing structure
7. Theme configuration

### In Progress ðŸš§
1. Registration page implementation
2. Chat interface components
3. Channel management
4. Direct messaging system

### Pending ðŸ“‹
1. Message polling implementation
2. File attachment handling
3. User profile management
4. Real-time features
5. Error boundaries
6. Loading states for async operations

## Technical Debt & Issues

### Known Issues
1. Need to implement proper error boundaries
2. Loading states required for async operations
3. Form validation needs enhancement
4. User feedback mechanisms needed

### Security Considerations
1. Input sanitization needed
2. File upload validation required
3. Rate limiting to be implemented
4. Session management to be enhanced

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Immediate**
   - Complete registration page
   - Implement chat layout
   - Add message components

2. **Short-term**
   - Set up message polling
   - Add channel creation
   - Implement direct messaging

3. **Medium-term**
   - File attachment system
   - User presence
   - Message reactions

## Resource Status

### Dependencies
- Next.js 14
- Supabase Client
- shadcn/ui

- TypeScript
- Geist Font

### Environment
- Development environment configured
- Environment variables set up
- TypeScript configuration complete

## Recommendations

1. **Technical**
   - Implement error boundaries before adding more features
   - Add loading states for better UX
   - Set up proper logging system

2. **Process**
   - Create component documentation
   - Add unit tests for critical paths
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline

3. **Security**
   - Review authentication flow
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Add input validation

## Timeline Update

- **Current Phase**: Initial Development
- **Next Milestone**: Basic Chat Functionality
- **Expected Timeline**: 2-3 sprints for core features
