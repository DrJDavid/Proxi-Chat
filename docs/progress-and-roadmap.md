# ProxiChat Progress Report & Roadmap

## Current Status (As of Now)

We're in the initial setup phase of ProxiChat, with our foundational infrastructure now properly connected. Here's where we stand:

### Completed âœ…
- Set up Next.js 14 project with TypeScript
- Configured Supabase integration
- Successfully established Supabase connection
- Defined database schema with tables for:
  - Users
  - Channels
  - Messages
  - Attachments
  - Reactions
- Implemented initial Supabase client configuration
- Verified basic connection testing

### Current Focus
- Setting up authentication system
- Implementing user management
- Creating initial UI components

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Authentication System**
   - Implement Supabase Auth
   - Create sign-up and login flows
   - Set up protected routes
   - Add user session management

2. **User Interface Foundation**
   - Set up shadcn/ui components
   - Create layout structure
   - Build authentication pages
   - Implement responsive design

3. **Core Chat Features**
   - Build user profile management
   - Implement direct messaging
   - Create channel messaging system
   - Add message polling mechanism

## Short-term Roadmap (Next 2-3 Sprints)

### Sprint 1: Foundation
- Fix current connection issues
- Complete authentication system
- Build basic user profile UI
- Implement main chat layout

### Sprint 2: Core Messaging
- Direct messaging implementation
- Channel creation and management
- Basic message display and sending
- Message polling system

### Sprint 3: Enhanced Features
- File attachments
- Message reactions
- User presence system
- Basic notification system

## Long-term Vision

### Phase 1: MVP Release
- Stable chat functionality
- Reliable message delivery
- Basic user profiles
- Channel & DM support

### Phase 2: Enhanced Experience
- Rich text messages
- Advanced file sharing
- Message threading
- Enhanced notifications

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Voice messages
- Message search
- User groups
- Custom emojis

## Technical Priorities

1. **Performance**
   - Optimize message polling
   - Implement efficient caching
   - Minimize unnecessary rerenders

2. **Security**
   - Proper authentication flows
   - Data validation
   - Input sanitization
   - Secure file handling

3. **User Experience**
   - Responsive design
   - Loading states
   - Error handling
   - Offline support

## Architecture Decisions

- Using polling instead of real-time subscriptions for simplicity
- Implementing Zustand for state management
- Using shadcn/ui for consistent UI components
- Strict TypeScript usage for better code quality

## Next Technical Tasks

1. Set up authentication routes and UI
2. Create user context and state management
3. Build chat interface components
4. Implement message polling system
5. Add error boundaries and loading states

## Risk Factors

- Need to ensure scalable polling implementation
- Message history management for performance
- File upload size and storage limitations
- Rate limiting considerations

## Success Metrics

- Message delivery reliability
- UI responsiveness
- Error rate monitoring
- User session stability

This roadmap is flexible and will be adjusted based on progress and changing requirements. Regular updates will be made to reflect our current status and any shifts in priorities.
